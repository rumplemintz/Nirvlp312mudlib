THe guild is centered around the town of Willow Grove. The town was built by the Black Willow Order. The guild gets its power from the number of worshippers of the faith. So what benefits the town in turn benefits the guild. That is the basic jist of it all. -S **charm**Subj: option?Date: Apr  5 19:49what was your only option? **charm**Subj: winkDate: Jun 16 19:45you wouldn't believe me if is said i wanted to come **charm**Subj: hmmDate: Jul 30 19:46if you missed me, you would be around more often then you are.. =) **"
