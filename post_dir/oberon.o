It will write to the /log directory and append to the file. Example: log_file("ADVANCE", ctime() + " " +cap_name+" advanced to level "+level+" ") This will write to /log/ADVANCE --John **vertebraker**Subj: Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: dragnar) darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Sep 27 22:27Guys,  I think it would be a good idea to remove sponsorship requirements from guilds.  For example, mages, samurai, shardak, etc.  Since the player pool is so small, I feel there is no point in having the requirement of waiting for someone else to login in order to enjoy 25% of the content of the MUD.  Any objections?   **oberon** Re:   Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: vertebraker) dragnar,darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Sep 29 19:01I think sponsorships are an interesting aspect.. I'm not sure if I like seeing it deleted all together. So, as an idea, what if we keep sponsorship alive on those guilds but add a mob that will sponsor somebody for 80k coins. Now you have a way for people to buy it, or do it for free if a player is on.  - Oberon **rumplemintz** Re:   Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: vertebraker,dragnar,darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Oct  7 14:01I like the idea of the coin cost, as it's insanely easy to coin up these days anyway.  I do agree that it should be changed. **dragnar**Subj: Always test with a test charCc: darkfireDate: Oct 11 08:44I fixed the login/logout messages for mages for when players have %NAME% in the login/logout commands this morning. When I first logged in to test it I logged in as DB. The guild_login function is called from player.c, and it is called before gear is restored. So guild_login failed and DB lost all of his gear lol. Always test with a test character :) **dragnar**Subj: Samurai headsCc: darkfireDate: Oct 13 23:49I added a head_count to the sam guild object. Spikes no longer save. If someone has a spike saved, the first time they spike with it it should add to the guild amount.  Please try it out and let me know how it works. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: room.c Cc: (To: fred) rumplemintz,shinshi,sami,vertebraker,oberon,darkfire,mosobpDate: Oct 18 21:59I always liked the way some rooms that had call_outs in them shut them off when no players were in the room. I finally got around to adding the functionality to room.c.  You can use the new: set_call_out( string co, int interval, int rand_interval )  to set the name of the call_out function, the interval and random interval. . In the inherited room you do set_call_out in the reset, then define the function that will be the target of the call_out. I'll put an example in /doc/build/room/call_outs. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: locker exampleCc: darudeDate: Oct 20 12:02soulbindmob.c - Mob that drops the weapon, sets the binder when it dies soulbind.c     - Weapon that tracks the soulbind, plus some specials I tested it and saved it in casino and it worked.

I was looking at the guild just out of curiousity and I may have found an issue. The lich and deathknight shadows are supposed to lower the damage the player takes I think. However it looks like they were never updated after the damage types were added. The shadow has hit_player, but not do_damage so it won't adj damage from mobs (at least most of it). I wasn't sure if you were aware. Do you want it fixed? If so do you want to fix it? I'll be happy to fix it, just didn't want to step on your toes and wasn't sure if it was the way you intended. Thanks, --Gnar/John **boltar** Re:   DragnarCc: DragnarDate: Mar  8 18:41  Dragnar's level is what ever he wants it to be. His current level of access  to the mud's files allows him to choose the level he wants. Well so  long as it is lower than mine of course ;)   So there's not anything to do promotion wise, for it's just ceremonial  numbers at this point.   **desiree**Subj: errorsDate: Mar  9 20:241. describe cobblestone everywhere 2. guardhouse2 describe cot, chair, armor and weapons 3. guardhouse1 describe cot, chair armor and weapons i checked nouns, grammer and mobs in each room...if i was suppose to check something else, please let me know thanks! *Desiree* **angel**Subj: quest levelsDate: Mar 23 22:27After dong many quest here I would say it is high on the physical  side since it takes killing an 850k and 250k mobs in a room that is no exit, no teleport and no quit. I would say 10.  On the  mental side I left many trails. The only stretch is figuring out  to place the saber on the shelf.  So I don't think it is as high  for the mental component. Maybe 7. Let me know what you think. **dragnar**Subj: Re:  fixed BF bugCc: (To: fred) oberonDate: Apr  2 00:47Honestly, Darude/Oberon did all of the hard work to figure out which guild spell was causing the issue.
