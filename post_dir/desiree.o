I'd like a standard text file format we can use for wizards who want an approval. Not sure if we need one for  each type of obj such as heal/mob/armor/weapon etc. or not. But I hate  looking at the files in a directory and some of the files are not even part of the approval. Also if the doc forced the wizard to list out the stats, it would make them do a final double check before approval.  . As an example, for mobs they would have to list the level, wc, ac, hps, gold, spells, and special abilities. Do you follow what I'm saying? If so I'd like to see if you have any input on what it should look like. . You should have never told me you have free time :) **angel**Subj: correctionsDate: Mar 26 23:20Hello Desiree,  Thanks for sending to correction list.  I hope to get it all down this week.  It was easy to understand looking through.  I am not sure if you have an FTP file transfer program or an offline editor.  It would be a lot easier for you rather than using the one line at a time mail systems we have. mail systems we have.  Ofline editor is like a word document and then using the FTP to upload it with a click of a button. Let me know if you need help with that! It is easy even if you simply upload to your file then just cp it to their open file.  Thanks again! **angel**Subj: FTPDate: Mar 28 20:41Hello Desiree, I don't mind showing you how to setup an FTP and the offline editor. I can explain coding anytime  I am on and you have questions. It would be best to start reading about code so things start to look familure even if you do not know how they  function.  You can leave pieces as you go and start learning to be a copier before you grasp  it all.  I would start with down loading 2 free programs. FileZilla and Crimson Editor. Also start reading  l LPC Basics Written by Descartes of Borg you can google it. **dragnar**Subj: quick mob listCc: **Date: Mar 30 08:38Bug Storm Granite Golem Ani Piccolo Gordie Howe Icing Death Duncan Game Crasher Mondar Deathmaster Snikch Shardik Massive Horde of Walkers Death Knight John Romero **dragnar**Subj: mobsCc: **Date: Mar 30 08:40Link The Grimm Reaper **dragnar**Subj: mobsCc: **Date: Mar 30 08:41Chandra **oberon**Subj: iarchCc: (To: careen) charm,desireeDate: Aug 27 10:07It's fixed. :) **"
