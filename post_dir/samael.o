messages "dragnar**Subj: login bonusCc: (To: sami) darude,rumi,samael,enceladusDate: Feb 21 23:45I added a few scrolls to the login bonus. Sami, find the bugs man lol Can anyone else think of unique items that already exist that I could add? I was thinking about the phoenix idol (still not sure as it is challenging to get) but let me know if you think of other items that I could easily add. If you do give me your estimate of the items cost if you were to buy with gold. Thanks. --John/Gnar **"
