messages "dragnar** Re:   cd /players/guilds/dervishDate: Jul 21 14:16I adjusted it to fire a bit more. Hard to do without having humble spamming out constantly. Keep in mind your ex level plays a big part into your wc bonus so the messages should get better the higher level you are. Your sand points fire the messages off, but the message is a combo of sandpoints and ex lev. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: Set of ShadowsCc: (To: sami) symbio,darude,silverwindDate: Sep 28 12:27I made a change to how the set checks to see if you have the full set to try and reduce battle errors. Please let me know if you have any issues with it. **dragnar**Subj: leveled mobsCc: **Date: Jul 19 07:55You have a samurai right? I always thought pai-mai was cool how he was done and I wanted to do something similar. Would be a cool 2nd area for you to have something like ooze that works for extra levels and maybe prestige levels. Random brain dump over. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: QuestsCc: **Date: Oct  4 08:22I did Morgoth's quest last night. Not needed for the quest, but the statues that come to life when you pry the gem made me remember being in that area when I was a player. When those statues came to life back in the day they scared the hell out of me lol. Then I checked my quest list for dragnar and realize I did that quest, along with the superman and disk quest etc. I have zero recall of doing those quests. Scary. Wish we had google drive back then :) --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: locker exampleCc: (To: oberon) darudeDate: Oct 20 12:02soulbindmob.c - Mob that drops the weapon, sets the binder when it dies soulbind.c     - Weapon that tracks the soulbind, plus some specials I tested it and saved it in casino and it worked. I did not try a save with my testchar by doing a quit but it should work... --John **dragnar**Subj: SolarisCc: **Date: Jan 19 09:33Fear IT! grep add_spell Solaris.c  | wc -l 32 **dragnar**Subj: SamuraiCc: **Date: Feb 16 21:45Getting there! Shardik tool forver, I had to use a crazy amount of detox. Top Kills for Current Reboot Period PLAYER          EXP        MOB Dreadbane       1,937,643  Demon Dreadbane       1,891,615  Shardik Dreadbane       1,534,446  Master ninja Syn             1,088,084  Oakley Dreadbane       1,020,380  Myla . In fact it took so long I missed Fred's double xp wore off lol **dragnar**Subj: FearsomeCc: **Date: May  6 22:08This is the "special ability" angel added to one of his mobs. When  it dies, it does this fearsome hit to the player: this_player()->hit_player(7 + random(9)) . I bet you're scared aren't you? **dragnar**Subj: /players/guildsCc: **Date: May 15 22:55I think you'd need to be a senior (100) to edit /players/guilds. Seniors can edit any file in /players.  why what's up? If you need access to something specific I can give it to you? Or is it just doing normal bug fixes? --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: LoginCc: **Date: Jul 30 17:14Bah Your login streak has ended at 46 weeks. **"
