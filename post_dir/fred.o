The problem is the mobs that have it are super hard to kill. Dreadbane has died multiple times getting a single set. And I see this gear on pretty much everyone. So, I created /players/dragnar/closed/mob which inherits from monster.c but does some logging if the mob is killed or dested. I then changed Jareel's mobs to inherit from my file instead of monster.c. It writes to /log/GNAR. Just letting you know in case I find something and we have fallout to deal with. **shinshi**Subj: CharmDate: Oct 13 19:30She wants to see if, as an extra prestige bonus, they can choose one attrib to keep for good  **dragnar**Subj: Guild codeCc: **Date: Oct 14 22:48Sorry, sent this to Rump and forgot to cc you: I've had 2 people ask me for access to guild code in the past week.  Both of them just want to view it offline.

I would like to give the players a prize for logging in on a regular basis. I was thinking daily and weekly prizes. Feel free to mail me ideas on what the prizes could be.  . Some idea I already have are gold, casino chips, heals etc. I also have some unique scrolls I have been working on for an upcoming area. They give unique 1 time abilities that raise your wc bonus, give a double xp, bless armor/weps, make any weapon unbreakable etc. I was thinking about using these for some of the bigger prizes. . Let me know any thoughts ideas you have. Thanks, --Gnar **careen**Subj: shucksDate: Jan  7 21:54Charm kicks her foot in the dirt and says Ahhh Shucks!    something like that! thanks! **dragnar**Subj: weeksCc: (To: rumplemintz) fredDate: Mar 31 09:34I want to give a login bonus to players that login frequently. I may do a daily login bonus, but I want to focus on a weekly bonus based on some measurement of actually playing, possibly getting a % of exp for your current level or something. . . Do either of you have any suggestions on how to keep track of the weeks? **dragnar**Subj: namesCc: **Date: Apr  9 20:08What is the rule on character names?

Those mobs don't heal, he got their health low while he was +100. Then he prestiged and after he leveled up a bit he went back and finished them off. Obviously not in the spirit of prestige, but I don't think we have a rule for this. Unless we apply character separation to before & after prestige? --Gnar **malt**Subj: zordCc: dragnarDate: Jul  8 15:33fred my zord seems to be bugged it says none space zord and it is supposed to be a velociraptor **shinshi**Subj: /players/shinshi/healers/spells/heal.cDate: Jul 25 19:33I can't figure out why it's displaying the message twice.

I found some code that Earwax started awhile ago for nirvana rewards that was never really used, so I am using what he started. . For the login rewards, looking for your feedback on the award. I'm planning on doing 5000 * the number of weeks. So week 1 you would get 5000 reward points, if you consecutively get week 2 you would get 10k. If you miss a week it breaks your streak and you start over. So if you logged in 52 weeks in a row on the 52nd week you would get 260k. I'm also looking at doing milestone bonuses for month, 3 months, etc. . When a player exchanges rewards for cash it will be at a 50% ratio. 10k rewards points would be 5k gold. Casino chips will be 1:1. Other items TBD. . Let me know what you think. I want the rewards to be big enough for the players to care about them. But if you think they are out of line let me know what you suggest. Thanks, --Gnar/John **brak**Subj: MaltDate: Aug  9 17:38Malt again.

I know some mobs break armor on the player.  Samurai can only reapir weapons, same with the smith in town. Did it just never get added? **vertebraker**Subj: Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: dragnar) darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Sep 27 22:27Guys,  I think it would be a good idea to remove sponsorship requirements from guilds.  For example, mages, samurai, shardak, etc.  Since the player pool is so small, I feel there is no point in having the requirement of waiting for someone else to login in order to enjoy 25% of the content of the MUD.  Any objections?   **oberon** Re:   Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: vertebraker) dragnar,darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Sep 29 19:01I think sponsorships are an interesting aspect.. I'm not sure if I like seeing it deleted all together. So, as an idea, what if we keep sponsorship alive on those guilds but add a mob that will sponsor somebody for 80k coins. Now you have a way for people to buy it, or do it for free if a player is on.  - Oberon **rumplemintz** Re:   Removing sponsorship requirements of joining guildsCc: (To: oberon) vertebraker,dragnar,darkfire,shinshi,oberon,fred,rumplemintzDate: Oct  7 14:01I like the idea of the coin cost, as it's insanely easy to coin up these days anyway.  I do agree that it should be changed. **dragnar**Subj: Rangers commandCc: **Date: Oct 11 11:32Hey Fred, the viewing globe is bugging out in the Rangers guild hall. When you type the 'Rangers' command it bugs on Whitehawk. I find it interesting that he prestiged and hasn't yet re-joined the guild. I couldn't find anything wrong with his .save file. I'll copy the debug.log into your home dir in case you don't login today. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: room.c Cc: rumplemintz,shinshi,sami,vertebraker,oberon,darkfire,mosobpDate: Oct 18 21:59I always liked the way some rooms that had call_outs in them shut them off when no players were in the room. I finally got around to adding the functionality to room.c.  You can use the new: set_call_out( string co, int interval, int rand_interval )  to set the name of the call_out function, the interval and random interval. . In the inherited room you do set_call_out in the reset, then define the function that will be the target of the call_out. I'll put an example in /doc/build/room/call_outs. --Gnar **dragnar**Subj: padCc: (To: darkfire) fredDate: Oct 26 07:44pad("~", 40, '~') Will make a string of ~ 40 chars long.

My intent when I made the scrolls for my area would be to make the price based on how many are sold. If I had time I would do something similar but no dice. Thanks for looking. --John **oberon**Subj: Hanzo SwordCc: dragnarDate: Mar  1 16:22Fred,  After chatting with Gnar about the Hanzo sword, I decided to run some tests to find out if it was even game-legal.  Turns out, it is actually a little weaker than the Elemental weapons, and Honed Longsword. It came in with 28/16 (average dmg / average real damage). The Elemental weapons came in at 32/22, and The Honed came in at 23/21.  Currently the Samurai mob that carries it destroys it upon death. I was thinking this would be a cool weapon to have in game, and it could easily be done just by adding in a random chance of keeping the sword on death.  I wanted to get your thoughts on this as well. Thanks!  - Oberon **oberon**Subj: Hanzo SwordCc: dragnarDate: Mar  1 16:27For note: "/players/vertebraker/obj/hanzo_sword.c" is the sword in question. **dragnar**Subj: BCMCc: oberonDate: Mar  3 14:45Hi Fred, Darude joined your bcm guild after his last prestige. I was looking at the guild just out of curiousity and I may have found an issue. The lich and deathknight shadows are supposed to lower the damage the player takes I think. However it looks like they were never updated after the damage types were added. The shadow has hit_player, but not do_damage so it won't adj damage from mobs (at least most of it). I wasn't sure if you were aware. Do you want it fixed? If so do you want to fix it? I'll be happy to fix it, just didn't want to step on your toes and wasn't sure if it was the way you intended. Thanks, --Gnar/John **angel**Subj: Masonic QuestCc: (To: dragnar) fredDate: Mar 16 11:52Greetings, I have completed a new area that is connected to my town area.  It is a quest inside the mansion on main street. Bassically, Gas City Mayor Bob Ray is a mason of the highest order and has been in  charge of hiding a masonic treasure. Since were a mud, I cannot give a huge treasure, I am giving 60k in coins, a Masonic Sword and a few special  heals.  The 2 mobs you have to kill back to back are a little under 1 mil exp. When killing second mob you cannot leave the room or quit out. The area is /players/angel/area/mansion 22 rooms, 17 npc, 9 obj I still need to create the quest obj to add it to the game.

Any questions, please ask! **gizmo**Subj: Warrior Score ChangeCc: noneDate: Mar 27 21:42If you have some free time, I would be REALLY nice if you could make the 'sc'/score for the Warrior guild to mimic the one for Bloodfist or such. Having your inventory items listed like they are currently gets bunched up and hard to discern what is what. All of the green color of it is hard on the eyes. The Bloodfist set up is just neat and clean. Additionaly, I would also suggest one other minor change. The bonus skill pt or stat addition seems a very odd feature. Personally, I think it should just be a bonus skill point, which allows players to customize their chosen profession a bit buy having another basic skill. For example, as a knight, I'm pretty much going to take the sword/shield skills, but would it be nice if I could throw a blindfight or maybe first aid there. Anyway, these are just some thoughts. Thanks for listening.  **dragnar**Subj: fixed BF bugCc: **Date: Mar 31 12:47Hey Fred, Just an FYI for you. Darude found a bug with BF. If you died while concentrate was active then prayed, when concentrate wore off it would make your stats negative.  I just updated the heart beat in the guild obj to remove concentrate if the player died. Easy fix. --Gnar/John **dragnar**Subj: Re:  fixed BF bugCc: oberonDate: Apr  2 00:47Honestly, Darude/Oberon did all of the hard work to figure out which guild spell was causing the issue.
