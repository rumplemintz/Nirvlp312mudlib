And of course you need both rings to combine them, so I find it curious that so many players have them. I've never gotten either one of them. **dragnar**Subj: HiCc: **Date: Dec  9 07:58Sorry my client logs me back in after a reboot (well sometimes it works) so I look active but I'm really not. How's things, I've been busy so I haven't run into you much lately. You have a list of Shardak things that need to be overhauled yet :) ? **dragnar**Subj: DOCc: **Date: Jan  9 10:15I can get you into DO, just let me know. You need to be level 15. I'd max pie and wil stats first. Gnar/Dread **dragnar**Subj: Re:   ThanksCc: **Date: Jan  9 11:13You know Gizmo can join other guilds too? When you restore your guild after doing a prestige you can pick from any guilds you've been in. Just an option! **dragnar**Subj: What's up?Cc: **Date: Apr  5 19:05What's up man, you sounded like something was going on with your comment on the gossip chan... **dragnar**Subj: RoguesCc: **Date: May 10 20:45castle shinshi join :) **dragnar**Subj: exposeCc: **Date: May 15 15:07It should work with mobs, just not sure it is worth the spell points... If you can't get it to work let me know. **randalar**Subj: thank youDate: Jul 18 19:03Thank you for the equipment!
