The returns flatten out right at the same max point so it should be not an issue there. Not sure if I am gonna be able to look at the other ones but if I can I will try and get one done tonight. By the way I did not do any spam on the extra specials so that still needs to be done.  Bob. **rumplemintz**Subj: LDDate: May  5 10:16I think I have this whole permissions thing figured out (not fixed!!)  With the stock 2.4.5 mudlib that comes with LDmud, everything works as planned.  I reverted some master/simul stuff back to that stock, and have narrowed the issue down to the resolv_path simul_efun.  That's where the path isn't getting calculated correctly, which adds the current path when it's not supposed to, adds a slash, etc....  We should just need to fix that simul_efun to work properly (or as expected) and our issues should go away.  **rumplemintz** Re:   SecurityCc: SecurityDate: Jul 13 09:56Interesting idea.  Server access would just require a user/pass on the server and not necessarily root access.  Could setup permissions for them to move files between the specific subdirectories that they should have access to  Linux security is way better than mud security, with the added benefit of forcing ssh access instead of telnet.  Would need to pass this by B  **rumplemintz** Re:   LD securityDate: Oct 22 13:17I'm guessing it's because cat() is now an sefun instead of an efun - so it's getting introduced into the stack.  I think we can get it to allow any obj/simul_efun call valid_write somewhere in master.c - if i remember correctly. **worm**Subj: heyDate: Nov  5 12:48man.. i wanna play here again.. but wtf is up with Spinal? shardaks took serious kicks in the balls over 2 spells...  darkness and spinal ... now spinal isnt worth the pile of bones its cast on and i dont even wanna see whats been done to darkness.. and the fighting system.. well, whatever, ill get used to that i guess? men in graveyard are like wtf hard.. hope the xp got a million times better. ..... anyway, is there anything you can do to make spinal not such a lil slut that dies when a zombie farts? dies when a zombie farts? err. yeah. err. yeah. lol fml.. maybe im too damn old and set in the old ways. anyway. let me know. **enceladus** Re:   login bonusDate: Feb 22 13:50Yo. Nice work on adding the extra scrolls! What exactly does the Scroll of Aegis (gear enhancement) do, if I may ask? When used, does it preserve the savability of the item?  I do have a few ideas for other stuff that can be added to the list of stuff to spend your login points on. I know you asked for stuff that 'already exists', but some of these things don't yet. I'd be happy to help code any of them if you'd like.  Scroll of Identify - Show info on an item/mob. AC/WC, exact weight, cost, etc (basically show in actual numbers/text everything about the item) for items, exact level, exp, gold, stats, etc for mobs  Create critter - From clans. Make and clone a custom mob to beat up for exp and gold  Free Death - If you have this item in your inventory and reach 0 or fewer HP, instead of dying you are moved to your login room and healed to 1, and the item is destroyed (one time use)  Corpse item retrieval - If you have this item in your inventory and die, you are transported to your login room, and the contents of your corpse are put in one of the boxes that your items are shoved in if you disconnect. The death still counts, and the item is then destroyed (one time use)  I'll get to thinking and see if I can come up with anything else.  Thanks for your work on this!  **rumi**Subj: Login bonus items:Date: Feb 22 14:06Hey Drag, Thanks for the new scrolls. Some other items I was thinking about: Some device that would allow you to sharpen weapons with multiple charges. There is the unbreakable one which is nice and I suppose this is similar.  Ways to teleport around the mud more effectively and efficiently  Permanent decorative tattoos or other items (purely cosmetic or otherwise)  A corpse using device for the select guilds that don't have them   Expand or bring back the use of Real Estate in relation to login bonuses (house building funds etc)  The ability to permanent autoload one item or piece of eq (can be super expensive)regardless of death etc.  Mini guilds! Login point used miniguild abilities ... so like for 50k login bonus points, you unlock the miniguild intox spell or whatever  Temporary pets Temporary pets  One use only high ac or wc items. (use it then lose it after one boot or wield/wear)  Thanks, Rumi save **boltar** Re:   OberonDate: Aug 22 15:28Otay. I have no objections.   **"
