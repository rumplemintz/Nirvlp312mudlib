I asked around a bit first to see if you were one of the beggar sorts and the general consensus was that you hadn't really asked for a damn thing from anyone :) I find great honor in being self-sufficient and I enjoy lending a hand to those whom only strive to better themselves on their own and don't feel they always need a shoulder to lean upon. keep up the good work and i hope those items were a good help in your journey to becoming a great warrior here someday. Jacob, the Emperor PS Can I have a new power supply for my computer this Christmas??? ;) **dragnar**Subj: gearCc: **Date: Feb 18 10:33I'm being lazy, write up the descriptions you want for your gear and  the types and I'll throw it togeter for you. --Gnar **santa**Subj: eqCc: (To: dragnar) santaDate: Mar  9 17:54red and white fur-lined thick jacket This jacket is custom-made just for Santa Claus, as only Christmas magic (and Dragnar) could make a jacket big enough to fit this guy.  red and white fur-lined pants These pants have the same consistency as sweat pants, because Santa needs all the help he can in order to fit pants.  red and white fur-lined stocking cap This stocking cap is all that is keeping Santa's massively wild mane of snow white hair inside.  white Christmas shirt  This shirt is pretty plain and is white, with a small Christmas tree in the center.  white gloves These white gloves were hand-sewn by Mrs. Claus herself. Rumor has it that it took her 200 years, because she's old.  mistletoe boxer shorts For some odd reason, just peeking out of his pants, you can see the tell-tale signs of mistletoe print boxer shorts.   Christmas lights Wrapped around Santa's neck, this "necklace" is just some Christmas lights lit up, blinking and twinkling away.  Coca Cola bracelet Santa's always been a shill, but he always shills Coca Cola products. This guy is blatant about his willingness to sell anything for a buck.  red and green glowing wedding ring This wedding ring appears to be hand-crafted, likely by some poor elf who was forced to work hundreds of hours in Santa's sweatshop, I mean, workshop.  wide buckled black belt This belt is more of a life preserver, because it is saving the lives of everyone around if it were to fail and Santa's pants were to fall.  gigantic red Christmas sack Who doesn't want to see what surprises are inside Santa's wrinkled red sack?  large snow-ready black boots These black boots are made primarily for stomping through mounds of snow or reindeer dung.  snowflake shield This weak-looking shield is almost transparent, as it is made out of pure Christmas snowflakes.  thick black reindeer whip This whip is the only way Santa can keep his reindeer in order. You know how much of a jerk Blitzen can be? Imagine him without Santa's whip. Also, is that elf blood on it? **dragnar**Subj: Equipment doneCc: **Date: Mar 27 14:04Enjoy.
