It's not available in the app store so you just gotta do a google search for it and make sure your security preferences allow you to use non-Apple approved programs.  It's good, basically like a Gmud.  I needed to change the font type and size and now I'm good to go.   **marek**Subj: restitutionDate: Oct  3 10:17Find a newbie and pay them 10,000 coins with no explanation.  That is your restitution. **dragnar**Subj: Clan locker roomsCc: (To: mosh) chrono,symbio,rumi,titan,skanDate: Oct  6 12:15I'm pretty sure clan locker rooms will no longer clean items dropped in them.
