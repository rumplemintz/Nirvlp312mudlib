   Saber
   --------------------------------------------------------
   The lightsaber is the cornerstone of the Jedi offense. 
   It is an elegent weapon that requires great skill and 
   practice to be mastered. Each skill point added to the 
   saber skill set will open another type of saber attack. 
   Each type of attack will need to be mastered by endless
   practice.
