hirams_key       - ok
hscript          - ok since it is given only from quest completion, correct?
/***Heal will not be for sale and I changed value to 0, so plavers cannot get gold***/
/***reward heal only***/
masonic_pin      - ok
masonic_ring     - ok
masonic_saber_01 * wc 16 ok Increase the value to reflect new wc.
masonic_sword_01 - ok
sign_03          - ok
swatter          - ok Description implies you could spank people with it. Would be
                   fun and easy to add some emotes from it. 
                   /**Changed to swat and added an action**/
                   
trowl            * This is my bad. I thought a trowl would be a weapon, so I 
                   suggested changing type to a dagger.  Change it back since
                   it is armor lol

/*******Changed Saber value to 1000 and the trowl is a wep, who knows what I was doing
 as I coded the whole area in one week over spring break.  I fixed the code as a weapon********/

ashley    - lev19 4000g ok
beatty    - lev19 4000g ok
          - Fix description "Knight of the Sun" /*****This is the actual Title*****/
chef      - lev11 50+r(17)g ok
entered_apprentice_01
          - lev17 2100g ok
fly       - Lev1 ok
gardener  - ok - lowered gold a touch to make him legal
hiatt     - lev19 4000g ok

/***********Made changes to both Hiram and Hiram_02***********/

hiram_02  * lev22 7000g + sword & ring + heals. Value is still out of line. I'm fine
            with the sword and ring being rewards for the quest, but the value of the
            gold and the heals has to be in the build rules.
          * set_ac_bonus set_wc_bonus set_hp_bonus are still being set, which
            inflates xp value.
          * If you follow suggestion below (hiram) on increasing level, another "special"
            ability will be needed besides corpse grab.
hiram     - lev30 45,000g
          * Hiram is not a mob that requires a full party to kill, so max level is 29.
          - Suggestion, move all gold to hiram_02 so player has to kill both to get reward.
            If you want the payout to be 45k move all gold to hiram_02 and raise 2nd mob to 
            be level 24.
          - Suggestion, have hiram_02 attack player when it is cloned.
maggie    - lev10 425g ok
maid      - lev8 330g ok
mayor_ray - lev24 3000g
          * Requires 2 special abilities. /****Added***/

morgan    - lev19 4000g ok
prep_cook - lev8 330g ok

         
Notes:
-------------------------------
You should randomize the gold a bit more in the future.

One easy way to do random is use !random. If you want 25% you would do
if( !random(4) )
random 4 will be 0,1,2,or 3. ! means when it is 0. So it has 1 in 4 chance.
