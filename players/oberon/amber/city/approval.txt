-------------------------------
gateguard
  - coins are too high, stats are good enough for level 20 however but
    level drives coins. Coins must consider gear, sword/shield push him
    over 1500.
guardboss
  - Level could be as high as 20. Could be 21 or 22 if you bump up the wc.
    Coins ok now.
shop keepers
  - Raise the level so guild spells will indicate difficulty

/players/oberon/amber/city/obj
------------------------------
heal     - Value has to be divided by the # charges, generic_heal multiplies the value * charges
healx    - Fix value
fountain - Remove the random image, unless you are going to do something with it before the quest is ready?
rop      - Should it store? Maybe lower cost and make it not store? Let's chat.

Notes:
- Update your castle so I can verify it works.
